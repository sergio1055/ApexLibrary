# ApexPredator

ApexPredator is a SwiftUI application built as a playground for testing new SwiftUI components and practicing modern iOS development techniques. The app currently relies solely on SwiftUI views for its implementation, offering a simple and direct way to explore new UI elements. Future updates may include migrating to view models and more structured architecture patterns.

## About

ApexPredator is designed as a testbed for SwiftUI experimentation. The project currently focuses on using SwiftUI views without the added complexity of view models or architectural layers. This makes it an ideal platform for rapidly testing new components and UI ideas. Future enhancements may introduce view models and additional architecture patterns to improve scalability and maintainability.

## Features

- **SwiftUI Components:** Experiment with the latest SwiftUI views, modifiers, and layouts.
- **Modern iOS Development:** Utilize Swift's newest language features and best practices.
- **Dynamic UI:** Build and preview interactive user interfaces with ease.
- **Future Architecture Migration:** Planned enhancements to integrate view models and structured architecture patterns.

## Architecture

The current implementation of ApexPredator is straightforward, consisting solely of SwiftUI views. This simplicity allows for quick prototyping and iterative design. Future updates may refactor the codebase to include view models and other architectural patterns to enhance code organization and scalability.
